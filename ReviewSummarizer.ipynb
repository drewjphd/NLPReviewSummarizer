      "Aldo's put a huge damper on our first night in Santa Barbara.  The menu tempted us with its description of  filet mignon \"medallions\" and mashed potatoes.  Who doesn't love a good steak?  We were optimistic when the bread and dipping oil was very tasty, but that is where things took a bad turn.  Our steak was looked and tasted like no filet mignon we've ever tasted before.  It was tough and grotesquely shaped, it was giant balls of gross drowned in a brown sauce that didn't  help matters.  No good steak needs to be drowned a sauce.  The mashed potatoes I thought were just not whipped enough, because the consistency was too chunky, but it seemed they were reheated, the way they stayed smashed together in a lump when you put your fork into it, like mashed potatoes the day after Thanksgiving.  They took 20% off our tab when they saw I hardly touched my food and asked if there was a  problem.  We were polite about it, but honest, hoping the owners take their customer's feedback seriously.  If this place wasn't on the main tourist strip, it would be empty.  We went the next day to that chain family joint on the beach, had fish tacos and a turkey burger and how I wished we had eaten there instead of Aldo's.  I hope they read yelp and make some serious changes in their kitchen.\n"

The pan sauteed salmon was served with a olive caper tomato sauce and rested on top of shaved squash and carrots. The flat iron steak was cooked to a medium rare, relatively tender (for the price, you can't expect tenderloin or ribeye), and topped with flavorful mushroom, pepper, onion, blue cheese, and chimichurri sauce. The fries was the typical frozen food supplier variety. It was fine as a side, but nothing memorable and definitely not worth ordering from the appetizer menu. I have to advice against ordering desserts at $8, and It didn't look like it was made in house.\n",

I did not eat it after my one bite, I was super upset about the service. So Never AGAIN! How do they even get four stars? I just don't freaking get it. I thought it was me just upset since we waited an hour for our food. How can you do that after making me wait for 1 hour? I super upset, the waitress didn't offer to help me out too much, I just told her that this wait is unacceptable. She didn't apologize. Another person came along, I'm not sure who she is but I saw her servering other table but she apologized and asked if I wanted another dish, she even offered me dessert.\n"

      "I read some of the reviews below and was a bit afraid to venture back to Aldo's after ~5 year haitus.  But, thank goodness I did.  Perhaps it is improvements implemented by the recent change of owners or maybe there are crazy reviewers simply out to misrepresent this establishment....whatever the case, my wife, 2 kids, old family friend and I had the most amazing evening last night at Aldo's....the food and ambience were perfect!   A terrific location with both an inside and outside eating area.  I am a gourmet and wine enthusiast and found the food to be superb.  The wine list is not extensive but my Daniel Gehrs Syrah was superb and well priced.  We started with fresh, hot bread accompanied by extra virgin olive oil with slivers of garlic...DELICIOUS!  My kids enjoyed coloring the kids menu which came with crayons (unusual for a higher-end Italian experience) and my daughter's chicken fingers came with the most succulent shoestring fries.  It does seem that the menu focuses on sauces...all of which were superb.  I had the porkchops with savory cherry sauce...both unusual and excellent, my wife had the Salmon with cilantro-based dressing (the Salmon was perhaps the best cooked I have EVER had), our family friend enjoyed the best meal on the table...fettuccine di mare (with a sauce that I believe had a light dairy base) which was not too heavy but contained a flavorful sauce and ample amounts of fish, scallops, and shrimp.  For dessert, they served my girls McConnell's ice cream with a few special touches of cherries and whipped cream.....and the adults enjoyed the Creme Brullee.  YUM!  I grew up in Santa Barbara, loved Aldo's as a child, and feel like Aldo's has finally been renewed after some lack-luster years.  We'll be back with guests and look forward to telling our Santa Barbara family in hopes that they'll return to this romantic but family-oriented gem!\n"

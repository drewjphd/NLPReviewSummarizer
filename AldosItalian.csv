1423270,2,2012-05-29,"We tried to go to Blue Owl's soft opening, but it didn't work out when the carpenter showed up unannounced.  We decided to use Axxess card and gave Aldo's a try.   The decor had a rustic Tuscan feel, especially if you choose to dine al fresco.  The lunch entrees were generously portioned and moderately priced.  The food was slightly better than national chain such as Olive Garden, but far from being good authentic Italian.  You can definitely tell that some components of your meals are not made from scratch, thereby, explains the moderate pricing and the generous portions.  Given the ambiance, price, and the quality, this place is right in the middle, nothing bad, but nothing that warrants more visits in the future.  

We got some complementary French bread with garlic dipping oil to start.  The French bread was typical grocery store quality French bread, but being a garlic fiend, I loved the garlic oil even if it was not made with extra virgin olive oil.  The pan sauteed salmon was served with a olive caper tomato sauce and rested on top of shaved squash and carrots.  The striation and fattiness of the salmon suggested that it was probably farmed and not wild salmon as the specials board suggested.  I was really hoping for some Copper River salmon.  The sauce was savory and tangy, but too oily.  The squash and carrot ribbons were not overcooked and maintain some of their crispness.  The flat iron steak was cooked to a medium rare, relatively tender (for the price, you can't expect tenderloin or ribeye), and topped with flavorful mushroom, pepper, onion, blue cheese, and chimichurri sauce.  The fries was the typical frozen food supplier variety.  It was fine as a side, but nothing memorable and definitely not worth ordering from the appetizer menu.  I have to advice against ordering desserts here.  It was expensive at $8, and It didn't look like it was made in house.  

The service was mediocre.  There were times when we wonder where our server went, but it maybe because we went during the end of the lunch shift.  When I got the check, I noticed that a 20% service charge was added onto the check.  Its atypical to add a service charge for a party of 4, two of which are kids by the way.  I dine out frequently and I know the etiquette to always tip on the amount before the discount and this is the first time I have seen a restaurant imposing a mandatory 20% service charge for everyone."
1423434,5,2012-04-29,Best italian food ever! Ciopinno is amazing!
1424172,3,2012-03-01,"Went their for lunch and had a pleasant meal. Was surprised to learn that their was a 20% mandatory service charge for the waiter. Sorry, but I don't like to be told what to tip. I will never be going back here for that very reason."
1424888,5,2013-08-04,"Aldo's has become an anniversary tradition for us. 

If you are looking for a great Italian meal, without breaking the bank, this is the restaurant for you.  The ambiance is great, combined with fantastic food and service. 

My wife enjoyed a very generous portion of Chicken Parmesan, and I had the BBQ chicken pizza.  Both of us were more than satisfied and didn't leave room for dessert. 

Has a great feeling of a family owned business, the type that you want to support and I hope they are there for a very long time."
1426761,4,2013-08-04,"We stumbled upon Aldo's on a recent trip to SB. Caesar Salad , mussels, Angel hair Pomadoro all delicious.Great change of pace than seafood and Mexican.The courtyard is charming and the prices reasonable."
1432674,5,2013-11-14,"Aldos has improved dramatically since Brad bought the place a few years ago. The food and service are consistently excellent, with many new choices and a largely organic and/or hormone-free menu. There is even gluten-free pasta! It used to be just a tourist trap due to its State Street location. Now it's an excellent restaurant that I recommend to locals as much as to out of town visitors."
1443678,2,2012-04-02,"I've been meaning to write this review for a while.

Came here to eat with my boyfriend and another couple. We had a reservation so we didn't have to wait for a table, which was nice, however when we got to the table it was several minutes before we were greeted and even longer before we got drinks.

The waiter wasn't great, and it took a while for our salads to come out. so long, in fact that our food was ready just 2 minutes after we received soup/salad, and they tried to deliver it to us! Obviously we weren't ready. Instead of acknowledging their mistake, and re-making our food, it sat in the window for 10 minutes. I could tell because by the time they brought it back everything was soggy and chewy. 
The food was not great and definitely not worth the price.

I don't live in Santa Barbara anymore, but when I go back to visit, this will not be one of the places I'll eat."
1443808,5,2013-12-09,"This is my new favorite Italian place in Santa Barbara. My husband and I used to be fans of Palazzio, but once we went here (which is across the street) we felt bad because we knew we wouldn't go back there. They brought out bread with olive oil when you get there. Usually, I would ask for some balsamic but I thought I'd try it without and the olive oil was really good. Usually I don't notice much flavor to olive oil but this one was great. We ended up getting caprese as an appetizer. They cut up the basil so that it's more like a salad which was different, but made it easy to eat. All the ingredients were amazing! The cheese that they used was SOOOO good and so creamy! Best caprese I've had! For dinner my husband got the Chicken Parmigiana and I had the Linguine de Mare. Both were very flavorful and delicious. We followed it up with some dessert. Creme brulee and cannoli. Muah! So good. Yes, overall the bill was expensive, but for what you got, it was well worth it. The setting is nice too for a romantic date and for a nice, relaxing dinner. I will definitely go back again and recommend it highly for nice and not too expensive (like other Italian places in SB) Italian food."
1444533,4,2012-12-07,"I love this restaurant! Great food, nice ambiance. I especially like the Kale salad. Try it out it won't disappoint . . ."
1449665,4,2013-09-05,"I go here nearly every time I go to downtown Santa Barbara (mind you, that's not often) but every time has been very good. They have great pasta and great pizza. They are a little on the pricey side, but when I got to places like this, I expect pricey anyways."
1456740,1,2013-05-10,"Aldo's put a huge damper on our first night in Santa Barbara.  The menu tempted us with its description of  filet mignon ""medallions"" and mashed potatoes.  Who doesn't love a good steak?  We were optimistic when the bread and dipping oil was very tasty, but that is where things took a bad turn.  Our steak was looked and tasted like no filet mignon we've ever tasted before.  It was tough and grotesquely shaped, it was giant balls of gross drowned in a brown sauce that didn't  help matters.  No good steak needs to be drowned a sauce.  The mashed potatoes I thought were just not whipped enough, because the consistency was too chunky, but it seemed they were reheated, the way they stayed smashed together in a lump when you put your fork into it, like mashed potatoes the day after Thanksgiving.  They took 20% off our tab when they saw I hardly touched my food and asked if there was a  problem.  We were polite about it, but honest, hoping the owners take their customer's feedback seriously.  If this place wasn't on the main tourist strip, it would be empty.  We went the next day to that chain family joint on the beach, had fish tacos and a turkey burger and how I wished we had eaten there instead of Aldo's.  I hope they read yelp and make some serious changes in their kitchen."
1459723,3,2012-05-30,"I would give this place three and a half stars, but probably not four. It's a nice location right on State Street, and the restaurant features an outdoor patio and indoor tables that also provide outdoor views framed by large steel-barred windows, which both charmed and frightened me. The place was practically empty when my girlfriend and I walked in, but that was probably because it was 5:30 on a Tuesday. Apparently Tuesday is Family Night, when children get free or practically free food, but since neither one of us had kids, we brooded a bit about society's privileging of breeders over barren folks. To mollify myself, I ordered a glass of Montepulciano, which wasn't bad, but they served it in one of those puny chintzy diner glasses instead of the big crystal fishbowls that make red wine taste extra fine. 

The bread was on the stale side, though great to dunk into the elixir of olive oil, fresh garlic, and parmesan shavings. My friend's vegetable lasagna came topped with steamed spinach, which she promptly tossed aside (which I then tossed into my mouth--it wasn't bad, just a tad mushy), and the noodles, ricotta, and sauce were good enough, though the zucchini and yellow squash seemed overly boiled. My linguine in tomato sauce featured two golfball-sized homemade meatballs, which were, again, not bad, but the pasta wouldn't qualify as al dente and frankly the dish was overpriced. The spumoni we shared (cuz, hey, Lydia's from Jersey!) went down easy, but overall, there wasn't much wow to the food."
1469105,1,2012-07-02,"This place should be avoided! The location is clearly the only reason it has business - I can't imagine any local would ever go here, it's nothing but a tourist trap.  The chicken parmigiana I ordered was so dark and oily - it was completely disgusting.  It felt like it was cooked in old oil.  The pasta underneath it was fine - but the chicken on top rendered the whole dish unappetizing.  The service wasn't terrible, but it was the kind of place where you're very aware of what you need at all times - we had to ask for water, look around for the server, ask for the check twice, etc., etc.   

And the best kicker - it's expensive to boot!  

Just don't. Trust."
1477974,4,2013-06-25,"I grew up coming to Aldo's in Santa Barbara (since I was 15). It was the only italian restaurant my parents wanted to go to every weekend. It's centered right on State St. with a cute little outside patio so you can watch the town go by while dining. All I can remember from this place was the olive oil and bread and great, friendly service.

While that hasn't changed the food may have. Perhaps my pallette has changed, but it was not what I expected on a recent visit. I really enjoyed the caesar salad. We ordered a garden pizza which was thin crust, but left much to be desired. The chicken/pesto raviolli was OK. The sauce was very lemony and sour, but the chicken was better. I was not too much of a fan. 

Again, service excellent and the heart and location is there. Maybe another dish would have been better? I'll probably go back for nostalgia's sake."
1479923,1,2012-06-30,"Creepy and crappy.  Bland and tasteless. Pizza crust like frozen pie. Bad choice, keep looking"
1484300,4,2013-05-31,"Had the shrimp and calamari in puttanesca sauce for an appetizer--5 stars.  The salmon cilantro was four stars, not as fresh as the shrimp.  Prices were reasonable for a nice dining experience on the patio on a gorgeous Santa Barbara evening."
1486643,4,2012-07-22,"Had a wonderful dinner tonight with my daughter.  From bay area and accustomed to great restaurants. Sat outside on patio and people watched.  Daughter had the farmers salad with grilled chicken....super delicious.  I had the red snapper special.  Beautifully plated, unusual presentation, and absolutely fabulous. Very unusual and snapper was exquisite.  Serve was helpful and lovely. Restaurant completely packed.  Can't imagine the bad reviews. Look forward to dining here again.
P.S. The food at other tables looked delicious too!"
1487424,3,2013-04-13,"It was good. The food did not leave a huge lasting impression, but I like the atmosphere."
1496537,1,2013-06-25,"We tried this place on Sunday night, around 7:30 p.m.  First we sat in the outside patio area, thinking it would be pleasant with the nearby heater and street-side ambiance.  Unfortunately, the noise level was distracting, then someone started playing a harp.  Normally we enjoy hearing harp music, but this was gratingly loud.  After waiting a very long time for anyone to come over to our table to even give us a glass of water, we chose to go inside, hoping to get away from the noise of the street and the harp, and to get some service.  Another mistake.  The indoor area had loud irritating music playing from somewhere (not the harp).  Still had to endure another wait, and finally got someone to take our order.  Then another person came to our table with bread and water.  Eventually a third person came out with our orders.  The soups we ordered were very good in flavor, but served lukewarm.  The warm garlic bread was warmer than the soups.  
Why the place was so crowded, we can't figure out, unless all the customers were first-timers like us.  With service and ambiance like we experienced, we definitely won't go back on future trips to Santa Barbara, and will not recommend it to anyone.  
I'm giving one star for the flavor of the foods we ordered, but that's the only redeeming quality we experienced."
1512881,3,2012-03-06,"I went this place for lunch and used groupon.
We ordered steak/pork chop/soup.
It was good, but waitress were rude. 
Nice place and resonable place."
1533069,5,2013-06-28,"I read some of the reviews below and was a bit afraid to venture back to Aldo's after ~5 year haitus.  But, thank goodness I did.  Perhaps it is improvements implemented by the recent change of owners or maybe there are crazy reviewers simply out to misrepresent this establishment....whatever the case, my wife, 2 kids, old family friend and I had the most amazing evening last night at Aldo's....the food and ambience were perfect!   A terrific location with both an inside and outside eating area.  I am a gourmet and wine enthusiast and found the food to be superb.  The wine list is not extensive but my Daniel Gehrs Syrah was superb and well priced.  We started with fresh, hot bread accompanied by extra virgin olive oil with slivers of garlic...DELICIOUS!  My kids enjoyed coloring the kids menu which came with crayons (unusual for a higher-end Italian experience) and my daughter's chicken fingers came with the most succulent shoestring fries.  It does seem that the menu focuses on sauces...all of which were superb.  I had the porkchops with savory cherry sauce...both unusual and excellent, my wife had the Salmon with cilantro-based dressing (the Salmon was perhaps the best cooked I have EVER had), our family friend enjoyed the best meal on the table...fettuccine di mare (with a sauce that I believe had a light dairy base) which was not too heavy but contained a flavorful sauce and ample amounts of fish, scallops, and shrimp.  For dessert, they served my girls McConnell's ice cream with a few special touches of cherries and whipped cream.....and the adults enjoyed the Creme Brullee.  YUM!  I grew up in Santa Barbara, loved Aldo's as a child, and feel like Aldo's has finally been renewed after some lack-luster years.  We'll be back with guests and look forward to telling our Santa Barbara family in hopes that they'll return to this romantic but family-oriented gem!"
1534777,2,2013-09-11,Skip this restaurant. The Caesar salad had little flavor and the ravioli that I had as an entree was pre bought and were flavorless as well. Go to trattoria Vitoria instead.
1541096,2,2013-10-11,"I am giving this restaurant two stars because we loved our waitress-- she was funny, attentive, and honest. The food however is a 0 star.

Why the food was awful: 

The dinner bread they brought to the table was stale.

The pasta isn't made in-house. When I asked after having a bite of the lukewarm lasagna, the waitress was funny and said, ""I wish we made our pasta fresh! The kitchen is just too small."" I swear my lasagna was microwaved, but since I liked our waitress I was afraid to ask. It was plain and uninspiring.

My partner had a salmon dish that was very bland. It came with a frozen vegetable medley side that had zero flavor, and some boxed mashed potatoes. To make up for this flavorless cafeteria food, a cilantro gravy was generously slopped onto the plate.   

To top it all off the prices are obscene for the quality of food. I could name 20 restaurants within walking distance from Aldo's that you will have a better meal at, but you have Yelp! and can figure it out on your own :)"
1550115,1,2013-05-15,"We came here for lunch last summer in July.  But I think we have to write our experience here as an alert for everyone.

Sure, my wife's parents traveled from a foreign country and we stopped by Santa Barbara   But having some foreign guests doesn't mean you could gouge us like crazy. I couldn't find my favorite restaurant in downtown so I had to come in here and settle.  Big mistake.

We ordered some drinks and also asked for 1 hot water.  The waitress did not mention anything out of the ordinary and brought us hot water (just hot water) in a pot.
We ordered some pasta (1 meatball pasta and 2 seafood pasta and a ravioli I think) and a sandwich.  The pasta was bland, the meatball was yucky, the seafood taste frozen, overall I would rather eat cafeteria pasta than these.  Food was not great, service was somewhat lacking.  At this point, we felt like let's pay for falling for this tourist trap and leave.

Now here comes the great part: they are charging us 18% service fees for having a party of 5.  It wasn't written anywhere in the menu or restaurant nor did they mention to us beforehand, but they charged it.  I could understand if it's a party of 6 or 8 or 10, but they said they charge 18% for any party bigger than 4. Or maybe they made it up just because we look like foreign tourists.

And they also charged us for TEA because they brought some hot water to us.  When I asked, why did you charge me tea when I did not even order it... if you charge us where is the tea-bag, tea leaves, creamer or even sugar?  The waitress said ""Oh I could bring those now"". What?  This is so ridiculous, but I figured that by the time she took off the charge for the tea, I would have to pay about the same amount for parking, so I just let it go.

The note for everyone is:  read Yelp and find a better restaurant, otherwise if you have money and want to get gouged come here.  There are many reviews saying there are new owners, but seeing all the 1-star and 5-star ""new owner"" reviews crisscrossing each other, I highly doubt it."
1550640,1,2013-03-03,"This Restaurant ruined the end of a great mother - daughter weekend  for a large group to eat there. First my daughter had found a Groupon special, so I called and asked Brad the owner if he could let me know if he would  honor it before I bought, he said he would. But when we got there we were told my daughter & I we could not use it.
Then our group was told he had a special menu for our group at a special price. We were able to chose from three pre selected item & when we got the bill ours ""special"" price was  that each plate was  double the price of the item on the regular menu!!! What a ripe off!!  
Plus at our table of seven where we received poor service &'warm water, our waitress had added a $58 tip. By the way, she was Brad the owner's daughter. 

I am asked by many people that know I visit Santa Barbara often where is a good place to eat. I will assure you I will make a point to tell people, small or large groups to STAY AWAY FROM ALDO'S RESTAURANT"
1557962,1,2013-02-07,"I've lived in Santa Barbara for 14 years and I can honestly say this is probably the worst food I've eaten here. 

The bread was flavorless and the olive oil tasted off. 

I ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and vegetables.  It was $35.

 The potatoes were clearly several days old. You know how when you microwave Thanksgiving leftovers a day or so later, and the mashed potatoes have a crumbly texture instead of a whipped creamy texture? If you do, then you know what these mashed potatoes tasted like. Also, they were barely warm in some places. 

And the vegetables. They smelled so bad I almost gagged.  I honestly don't know how you could make carrots and zucchini taste that bad. 

The filet was mediocre and the only nice thing I can say about the sauce is that it helped mask the offensive flavors of the side dishes. 

My husband ordered the flat iron steak and had similar comments. 

We both left with a stomach ache that cost us $90. I feel like such a sucker."
1579775,4,2012-02-12,"Yummy neighborhood restaurant, in the middle of downtown. The food is tasty and clean, good ingredients. Pleasant atmosphere."
1586658,2,2012-03-12,"This was my first visit to Aldo's under its current owner. I was not impressed. I had some kind of pasta in ""pesto"" sauce which was actually pasta drowning in a little pesto and a lot of lemon. I've had better meals at Presto Pasta!! The bread basket they placed on our table was kinda dry and not even warm. The waitress told us they were rushing everyone since there was some kind of show going on at the Granada. Well, we weren't going to the show, couldn't we enjoy our meal? I won't be going back. On the other hand my boyfriend really liked his meal - he had the surf & turf."
1594051,4,2013-07-24,"I have found the food to be quite delicious on my visits there. I have had the pasta del mar (or something close to that name) which is exquisite, as well as the spaghetti and meatballs which is pretty good. I would highly recommend"
1595902,5,2012-01-12,love the new menu .brad has done a great job making locals feel welcome.
1600895,2,2013-11-27,"This place is just like olive garden.  
carbs drenched in olive oil and tomatoes- 
just hasn't been franchised yet."
1603800,5,2013-07-06,"I don't know why this place has some bad reviews - I went here with my family on the 4th of July from out of town and there were 6 of us with some picky eaters.  We all really enjoyed everything - in fact, I loved my food!!  

I liked the truffle fries and I thought the Japanese Pumpkin Ravioli was super yummy and had a great sauce/flavor.  Also - the portions were not too big, they were actually filling without being too much.  I tried some of everyone's dinner and I thought each entree had a great flavor.  I would definitely come here again!"
1607723,4,2012-10-22,"Dinner was terrific, the server was friendly and efficient and the patio was charming.  The price was right too!"
1609278,2,2012-05-14,"A friend picked this place for dinner and although I read the reviews on Yelp that weren't too pleasant, I went into this place very positive and open minded. You never know, maybe people have high standards and the restaurant is actually really good? 

I have to say the service was pretty good. Our server was nice and attentive. We got a table without a reservation as soon as we got there. 

I'm not really sure how anyone could like the food at this place. It's clearly a tourist trap. The food is very blend and some of it even disgusting. I took a bite of mussels and had to spit it out in my napkin, because it tasted like it has gone bad. I'm not a complainer and didn't want to ruin my friend's dinner, so I didn't say anything. The vegetarian pasta I had was okay, but lacked flavour, so I had to add some olive oil and salt to make it taste somewhat okay. I was hungry so I had to eat. After all this place is not cheap either. 

Bottom line: Probably the worst Italian food I've ever had. :("
1613257,1,2012-05-13,"This was not a great experience. The waiter was terrible and the food was worse! In my opinion it is pretty hard to screw up Italian food, but this place managed to do exactly that. The appetizer came out and the ravioli was frozen! My girlfriend and I split the linguine and meatballs which tasted like cheap grocery store marinara with packaged noodles and a semi warm meatball on top. We will not be returning! Oh yeah-- the bathrooms are in the kitchen!! I don't think I even need to elaborate on that..."
1620528,1,2012-02-20,"Unless you feel like spending your weekend with food poisoning, STAY AWAY!

My Boyfriend and I spent our two year anniversary in Santa Barbara this year, and were super excited to try Aldo's. I even emailed to make reservations about a month ago. Well Saturday night comes, and we arrive for our reservation a little early. About 5 minutes after being seated, we place our order. (We'd already decided on what we wanted before hand) This is where the fun began.

1) An older couple was seated next to us and waited roughly 20 minutes before placing their order, but received it long before we did.
2) We overheard a group behind us ask the waitress if they could please order something else, since the chicken they ordered was COMPLETELY raw..... 
3) My salmon and my boyfriends steak took roughly an hour and a half to be served to us. (They were not overly busy)

My salmon was drenched in sauce, I can only assume after the fact to hide it's rotten taste, because I wasn't even half way through it and I felt TERRIBLE. My Boyfriend had one bite of it and he started to not feel very good either. His steak was way overcooked, and tasted extremely bland. Another strange thing we noticed was just how often, at least 10 times, we were asked how the food was. Once or twice, okay. But it was as if they knew damn well what they had served us was ill. By the time we left the restaurant it was full blown food poisoning for me. Happy Anniversary! 

Needless to say, we will NEVER be returning to this place again, nor would we wish it on our worst enemy. Good riddance Aldos."
1626698,1,2012-02-13,"Terrible service. Took an hour honestly for our food to be made. They made it seem like they didnt want to serve us breat. Poor experience, go somewere else"
1631128,3,2012-09-24,Don't get the steak... My replacement dish was good and the staff was extremely nice... especially the owner.
1639485,5,2013-04-23,"Good services, good food (give the parm fries a try!), and gotta love the outdoor patio seating. A little on the expensive side, but worth the patio."
1641137,2,2012-11-02,"I really wanted to like this place because they give back to the community, which I appreciate.  But I didn't.  I fear for restaurants like this (e.g., Mimosa, just shuttered, also on State) that have mediocre food and high prices. We were there on a Tuesday and it was basically empty. Service was fine, but food sub-par.  I had the pork chop ($20), which was a standard size (not thick as I would expect), covered in a gloppy cherry sauce that overpowered the dish.  Mashed potatoes and veggies were ok but bland.  My wife had the scallops ($23), which were small and not tasty.  Bread was as someone else said, straight from Ralph's. Just way too much to pay for a so-so meal."
1642327,5,2013-11-30,"Just walking up and down State st. Looking for a nice place to eat. We picked Aldo's cause the patio looked so cozy, and it was. I'd come back again next time we pass through town. The sauce with the mussels was amazing! We also had crab cakes, scallops and a fettucini. The only thing negative I could say is I didn't love my wine choice, the house Pinot. Our waitress was great too, very soft spoken but attentive.  Ill be back."
1642980,1,2012-09-26,"I don't like giving bad reviews, but the food just wasn't very good at all."
1650430,1,2012-05-21,"I knew that Aldo's was under new ownership, so I gave it a try.  I don't think I will
return.  The service was mediocre at best.  When our waiter wasn't around and
we needed something, which seemed to be the case, 3 other employees stood
around literally doing nothing.  The food was not good.  The salad seemed like
it came from a bag (not fresh), dressing also not homemade, and if it was, they
need a new recipe.  Overall the experience was bad.
I am a local who used to work in the business and I know the owner.
He is a great guy and I hope he will look at this as positive criticism."
1653709,3,2012-05-18,"Showed up right when they were opening for lunch. Sign said to pick a seat. We sat on the patio. Watied over 5 minutes for anyone to greet us. I finally went inside and found an unfriendly server. He came out with menus after a few more minutes. 
Ordered the blackened chicken salad. Large portion and was tasty. 
The patio location was very  nice! Enjoyed the food and atmosphere, just didn't really have great service."
1661669,2,2012-07-11,"Service and atmosphere was nice  and our waiter was concerned about whether we enjoyed our food but YIKERS!....the food is really not too good. I don't understand how I always see this place crowded. Perhaps the local and the tourists. 

The steak was cooked nicely, but the ""chimichuri"" was on the side so did not impart any flavor and didn't taste like chimichuri. The topping on the steak didn't go with the dish. 

But, more importantly, DON'T order the scallops. They were awful. The dish is $24.95 and came with about 5 very small, unseared scallops swimming in a pungent wine/fishy-tasting broth. The broccoli spears thrown in didn't add any flavor or make any textural sense. The tasteless polenta in the center certainly didn't help anything. Felt like an amateur cook just used what he/she had in the fridge. Really frustrating to pay that much for something I'd be embarrassed to make and feed myself with no witnesses. Judging by the reviews, I don't think this was an off night."
1667670,1,2013-10-20,"After reading the reviews from everyone else most of everyone complained about the food, service, and EXTRA Charges. Went to this place on 10-18-13. I have to say the owner of this restaurant loves to charge any type of extra fee he can. They charge $15 for sharing a plate, they charge 18% gratuity for a party of 4 or more, they gave us extra plates and got charged $18, we brought our own champagne and glasses and serviced  and cleaned up by us not the employees we got charged $30. So if you want to visit this restaurant be careful don't ask for an extra fork or a refill on your water you will get an extra charge on your bill. I visit Santa Barbara monthly with friends and family and I will make sure no one I know will visit this restaurant."
1671111,1,2013-04-05,"The reason I am giving them 1 star are as follows:

- Have to ask for bread (other customers didnt have to wait 10 minutes or as for it)

- Didnt bother on making any recommendations, as to what is good

- Food I ordered (Ravioli Rosa) was swimming in this overly salty broth, instead of sauce

- Not once did the hostess checked back on us on how our food is  (again, we are oblivious to them; they DO check on other customers)."
1677399,3,2013-04-29,"Ordered three dinner entrees and a bottle of wine for a group five. 
We were all going there for a lighter dinner and since we did not order 5 entrees, they wanted to charge us a service fee. Rubbed me the wrong way and I would not recommend this place for a ""family"" style type of dinner.  

Atmosphere is nice and ambiance was charming. Service was inviting and efficient and our entrees were tasty."
1678776,5,2012-04-17,"I have a super soft spot in my heart for Aldo's.  Its very romantic atmosphere, good food, and helpful servers get me.  Plus I love Italian food and they do a good job.  Their olive oil that they serve with the bread is amahhhhhzing.  I don't know what they do to it, but it's fantastic.  I am a vegetarian, so I can't judge the meat dishes, but everything I've had from gnocchi to eggplant has been delicious."
1679660,1,2012-12-22,Horrible waitress... She told us she would charge us $15 to split a plate if anyone wanted to share a dish. I asked her if I had a bit of my friends pizza if she would charge me and she said yes! Really? I could tell she was from. The east coast... She was blunt and came across as rude. We were there for a burial party brunch and she was not accommodating  at all. She informed us that we all had to order food otherwise we were wasting her outdoor space.  Really? I think a bunch of cute 20 something's would make the place look a little better with people actually sitting at the restaurant. Because of her rudeness I would never go back. Ever. And the food was not very good.
1686975,5,2013-02-08,"The new owner has worked very hard at listening to the feedback and making any necessary improvements and I just wish the negative reviews could be deleted. Someone who had a less-than-stellar experience six months ago will find a meal, atmosphere, and service that they will not be able to badmouth now. 

The food is excellent, the ambiance is delightful, both in the courtyard and indoors, the service is attentive without giving you the sense of being invaded or hovered over. Reviewers who just make mean comments because they can, this being the anonymous Internet, just make themselves look bad. Better to post constructive criticism, I feel. At any rate, I have no criticism at all! 

Last night's meal was excellent, the wine suggested was right up my taste buds, we were well taken care of and, most importantly, the food was delicious. This restaurant has been around a very long time and it has undergone a wonderful renaissance. If you do try it and something is less than perfect (oh my, you're upset because the bread isn't the best bread you ever had in your life...?), then just ask to speak to Brad about it. He will hear you!"
1690409,4,2013-11-12,"The outdoor seating in the patio under a nice warm heat lamp in the slightly chilly night is quite pleasant. The waitress was friendly but she was slow and didn't refill my drink. The seafood linguine was the special of the night. It tasted fine and normal -- nothing spectacular. An appetizer, entree, and two drinks came out to be about $50 with t&t."
1694609,5,2013-03-16,"My husband and I ate here because we were walking by and the patio had such a nice atmosphere about it we couldn't help but eat here. My husband even hates Italian food but he wanted to eat here because it was so lovely with the waterfall, heaters, and soft lounge music.  We were very happy to see it was well priced and had a lot of vegetarian options.  The food was really good, so good my husband liked it.  We had the tiramisu for desert and it was five star fantastic! They also have a really good well priced wine list. Very nice romantic night."
1696131,4,2013-01-20,"Great service and excellent food. I don""t understand all the negative reviews. We had a great time. Oh..ok, the bread was just average."
1700037,2,2012-09-08,"Tourist trap, and I fell right in.  Guilty.

Hm, not sure where to begin on this one.  So let's start off with the bread.  The bread is straight off the shelf of Ralph's, and the olive oil with garlic is 100% pure garlic.  It was painful to even taste, so I asked for marinara sauce.  Oh, but that came at the price of $2 and 30 minutes.

Quickly decided I needed a drink, and what better to suit a Sunday holiday afternoon than the classic bloody mary.  That can't be to hard, right? Wrong.  It was a watery (and incredibly bland) tomato-like juice with perhaps a drop or two of vodka.

Onto the pasta and salad, perhaps on par or worse than the bloody mary.

I wish I had read the reviews before coming, so hopefully you'll take my word for it and save your $40+ dollars on a meal here."
1700487,4,2012-09-08,"I don't know what previous reviews are talking aobut regarding the bread and olive oil.  It was fantastic - I absolutely loved the garlic and the bread was scrumptious.   Our meals were also delicious, the staff was great and we had an wonderful lunch."
1700738,2,2013-01-21,"I spent this dinner with my boyfriend and another couple in one of those awkward, half-booth, half-chair tables squished in the middle of the tiny restaurant. I ordered the linguine and meatballs and got all of 2 meatballs... TWO! So, if you find yourself on this block of State St. and hungry for italian food, skip Aldo's and head directly across the street to Palazzio where the portions are huge and the atmosphere is fun and not claustrophobic."
1702169,1,2013-11-18,"Purchased a coupon through TravelZoo and didn't use it in time for the offer. Paid $50 for $100 of food and a bottle of wine. I wasn't upset that i couldn't redeem this coupon because it was my fault for not redeeming during the coupon time frame, HOWEVER if i paid $50 for this i expect to redeem this AT ANY TIME.!!! The Manager said since it was a Saturday i couldnt redeem what i paid for!! WTH????

The waitstaff and MANAGER (Females) seemed to be prejudice..We had bad service, plus food isnt that great. It was my 1st and LAST time there. I let the Manager know that i was not happy, She said ""OK"" and left it at that....they didnt do anything for me to get anything free or a discount to redeem my $50 i paid for so WTH was the problem. It should have been treated as if i bought a $50 gift card. They dont honor Saturday's for dinner on these offers is fine, but i could no longer get the offer. I just wanted what i paid for. 

I hate this place!! Should have just gone across the street to Palazzio soooo much better!!!"
1703124,1,2012-06-17,"I was recently at this restaurant with my family for my mothers birthday. I had been warned that the service wasn't that great, but I had made the mistake of purchasing online coupons prior to going there. Upon arriving It was brought to my attention that I couldn't use both the voucher and coupon during the same visit which is understandable, but the attitude I received from Megan their manager on duty, was very short and uninviting. We ended up leaving and this empty restaurant seemed just fine with that. In conclusion, I am the type of person that when I go out to eat and spend my money I expect to be treated in a friendly welcoming manner, this place is not like that at all... I have even received friendlier service and at least a smile from the employees at McDonald's. This should not be a stop for anyone on vacation considering how many amazing restaurants exist in this beautiful town."
1713278,3,2012-02-22,"Ok, so this is again an over all of 3 starts.

Went here with groupon, up to 42 dollars you can get the food here.

Food was really good. Steak in rare was perfectly cooked and fries were well seasoned. Ravioli rosa was good with addon of scallops.  Sword fish soup was also good.

However, with the groupon purchase, the ""service charge"" was 18%, mandatory. Plus, the waiter who took our order didn't mention that the sword fish soup was over the ""side soup limit"".

Overall the food was great but I'm not going to come back again."
1714278,4,2012-05-18,"My GF and i are in town on a mini vacation and stopped by here for an early dinner. It was very good. The bread was fresh and warm, the oil for dipping was excellent,tons of garlic and hi grade olive oil. I had the pesto salmon, very tasty. The sauce was good not to overpowering and the mashed potatoes were some of the best i've ever had, very creamy. My gf had a ceasar salad which i tasted and was very good and the linguine carbonara and she liked it also. The waiter was very nice and attentive. We had a nice expierience here."
1714910,4,2013-08-26,"My best friend and I stopped by here for a quick lunch.  

I was rather disappointed with my $6 glass of moscato, which was pretty much just a mouthful of moscato, but the food was pretty decent. 

The olive oil garlic dip pairs very well with the fresh warm bread they serve.  I also enjoyed their tiramisu.  Had their linguini di mare and it was pretty good.  I believe it was $13.95 for my entree.  Came with a bunch of scallops, three whole shrimps and a couple pieces of salmon.  Wish it came with more shrimp or salmon (I know those are pricier), but I believe it was worth the $13.95."
1722590,1,2013-03-06,"TERRIBLE service, very overpriced and average quality food"
1723553,5,2012-05-17,"We hosted the rehearsal dinner for our son and daughter in law on June 25th. It was a great success. 
The communication with the owners was very cordial and accomodating. 
We hosted 50 guests which was a perfect number for the venue. We started with wine and beer in the patio with a lovely variety of appetizers. It was great to be outdoors and able to mingle. 
Then we went inside to dine on a delicious salad, the Elvis salad, a favorite of the bride's. Each guest had preselected from 4 choices: steak, mahi mahi, chicken piccata or ravioli rosa (vegetarian). 
After the entree the guests moved back out to the patio for some fun and singing. 
Guests returned to a new seat and place setting. Each table received a variety of desserts to sample and share. 
Everyone enjoyed their dinner and the staff was delightful. 
We live in San Francisco so all planning had to be done via email. Every request was honored, even addressing guests' food alergies. 
Thanks to Aldo's for creating a wonderful event for us. Five stars!"
1735547,5,2012-11-29,"We had gone there for dinner.. I would recommend those  to whoever visits Santa Barbara.. Loved the food, great taste and very good service.. Will surely be going again...."
1741524,4,2013-06-23,The food here was good and arrived on time even though the restaurant was very busy.  We sat in the courtyard under the string of tiny lights.  Our waiter was attentive and was able to answer any questions we had about the menu.  We would definitely return here.
1742247,3,2012-02-25,"Food is great at first, but later will become too greasy and salty. They charge mandatory service fee at 18%. The server also did not tell us the soup for side dish has different price mark when he recommended them."
1747045,5,2013-10-03,Honest to god had the best fettuccine Alfredo!  Also their chocolate raspberry brownie dessert is to die for!!!!!
1758151,4,2013-12-02,"We opted to take a look at the Aldo's menu this past Saturday while waiting for a friend to meet us on State Street for lunch.I thought, well,  ""Smells yummy and I'm a sucker for a place with paninis...""

Thus, lunch decisions were made!! It has a cute little outdoor patio that seemed to be filling up around the 1 o'clock hour, so we opted for an indoor table, which was just as nice, being they had an open bright window seat available. There seemed to be two servers on duty-one servicing the patio and another lady who waited on the inside tables. Although it took a little while to place our orders, we could clearly see she was hustling and balancing her tables in a pleasant and efficient manner. Our server was very sweet and made lunch recommendations based on how hungry/not hungry we were.

I opted for the Caprese panini with a side salad and the quality of the cheese, basil and tomato were definitely above average considering the reasonable lunch price. The side salad had a house made dressing-some type of vinigrette which was the perfect blend of spices and a little bit of a sweetness to it. Fresh greens and carrots perfected the side dish and the focacia bread my sandwich was made on, was just the right amount of soft yet a little bit crispy on the outside. Very good quality all around. My boyfriend got the caprese but added chicken on it and opted for the fries. They piled the fries up high and they were seasoned with a bit of garlic, salt and some oregano or parsley (not sure which) but I had to partake in a few of those-they were seriously addicting and some of the best fries I've had in a while (not that one seeks out quality french fries in an Italian joint, but hey, they did them right!)

Plentiful refills on our drinks and they brought out some bread prior to the meal, which was okay-nothing stood out, but their olive oil dipping sauce was pretty amazing-I ended up dipping some of my sandwhich in to it-mmmm....

All in all, not a bad lunch option on State Street-clean space, fresh ingredients and friendly service. Minus one star, though, for having to walk in to the kitchen to use the restrooms-it detracted a bit from the experience. I always find that type of set up strange, especially in an establishment that charges a bit more for their food..."
1772026,1,2013-01-20,The service was extremely poor.  The waiter spent his time chatting to a british couple apparently amazed by their accent while we sat there being ignored. My food was cold and they didn't notice my glass was empty the entire dinner. Seriously move on to something better. This is a trap that has good styling on the outside but very poor food and worse service.
1775926,4,2013-08-12,"I came to Santa Barbara for a fun day with my boy Julius. I heard that Aldo's gives you a discount if you show that you took the train. I made reservations a day before our trip. They were kind and friendly. We got there, and it is a small place, which is OK. It has a nice patio and a very nice indoor area. I wish we could've gone later to see it at night, but we had to have dinner early because we had to take the train. One thing I didn't like was the location of the restrooms; it is by the waiter's station, almost in the kitchen. In the restroom there is not a big mirror, only two little ones. If you are a girl, you kind of want to be able to look at yourself in the mirror and retouch your makeup or fix your hair.

The food was OK. We had a linguine Bolognese. I had to order a simple food because I was sharing with my toddler. The funny part is that my boy was so hungry, that when the waitress comes, he says ""Fries!!!"" and so he had them, lots of them. Our waitress was nice and polite. The only thing is that I ordered a glass of wine and never got it. But it's ok, because I should not be drinking while I'm in mommy duty.

If I come back to Santa Barbara, I'll go to Aldo's again, just with company, so mommy can have a glass of vine and more food...yummy."
1784919,4,2012-08-12,Stopped there for a late night bite. What a find. Scrumptious veggie pizza and crab cakes on the side. Service was exemplary. I would ask for a booth next time though. Romantic spot.
1790017,4,2012-09-08,"Had dinner here tonight, prices were high but our food was absolutely delicious!! We will definitely go back!"
1794714,4,2012-02-25,"Service:
-Really good, although immediate refills would have been appreciated

Ambiance:
-Really cute and romantic. Went for dinner and sat out on the patio--yay heaters! Music was also nice.

Food:
-We got the Parmesan fries, which were unfreaking believable (would go back just for those), the meatball linguini, which was decent, and the bbq chicken pizza (which I thought was a little bland, while my partner didn't but he agreed it was missing something).

Price was about what you'd expect from this sort of place.

Overall:
Would definitely consider going back!"
1796872,4,2013-02-20,"I think my husband and I went on two different datenights here last month! Great, cozy ambience with indoor and outdoor seating. May not have tried this without the Axcess deal, but I'm glad that we did. I understand they are under new management and they probably still have a few kinks to work out, but it was a decent dining experience both times with tasty, rich food and plenty of fresh bread. The hostess Sophie is the best!"
1818400,4,2012-01-31,"I have been to this place a bunch of different times and it has always been constantly pretty good.  The service has always been good and it's always been very clean and the wait staff attentive.
       It's not going to blow you away but when you want to come to a place that's quiet and the service is good and you know you're going to be seated that day (leaving out the name of another spot here....) check this place out for sure."
1851947,3,2013-08-02,"Stars are given for the ambience, our waitress and a fabulous Pino Noir. Stars taken away for the food.  The Marg. pizza was very disappointing. Too much cheese - and random pieces of yellow zucchini planted into about an inch of thick cheese  (am guessing the chef is not Italian?).  Salad was soggy and then discovered they had cut my bloody pasta up into small pieces and drowned it in sauce.  I am 42 years old people, not 5. I know how to twirl my pasta around a spoon.   Needs more flavor and less sauce. 
I will return to this place later on to see if things have changed."
1875951,3,2012-10-28,"My husband and I were only in Santa Barbara for one night and decided to stop here to eat after wandering up and down State Street. It was a warm night so we sat out on the patio with the few other patrons that were there. No one was eating inside where it was ""air conditioned"". Probably because it was actually warmer inside than out.  
My husband ordered that day's special of the surf-n-turf. Stupid name for a meal but was pretty good with a very large portion of steak. I ordered the Japanese pumpkin ravioli with shrimp. Again, a large portion, and I thought quite good. 
The service was prompt and attentive and the atmosphere was nice since we were sitting right beside the fountain. The only disappointments were the so-so bread and lack-luster and completely mediocre tiramisu. I really wish Italian restaurants would start trying harder on their classic desserts. 
But overall it was pleasant for us."
1877276,5,2013-08-02,Love this place! The ciopinno is the best!
1888404,3,2012-10-29,"Service was top notch, and the hostess was very sweet to us.  For an expensive Italian restaurant I would say our main courses were just average but not necessarily worth the money.  I can confirm the bread was some kind of joke, tasted like day old super market bread.  Probably wont be back for a long time."
2039069,1,2012-07-24,"Worst experience EVER! We were too tired to go drive anywhere so we decided to just check this place out. 

We got seated immediately and that made me happy. However It took our server about 15-20 mintues to just greet us and take our orders. We got water and bread from the busser/bus boy. Once we order we noticed there were 3 empty tables. So we're eating our bread and the tables slowly starts to fill up. The tables are quite close together, so I coudn't help but notice how we got our soup the same time the table next to us did. 

Worst of all is when the server dropped off the soup. So the tables are really close, she decides to place herself in the middle of the two tables, stretch her arm out, and she facing the wall while she's doing this and she lowers her arms to put the soup bowl down without trying to see if it would spill or not. Why did she do that? Why can't she face one table, put the soup down and turn around face the other table and put the soup down? I just don't freaking get it..Anyhow luckily the bf grabbed the bowl from her before she completely let go because she placed it on his silverware. The soup was about to topple over. 

So beside the fact that she didn't think correctly why is our soup 25 mintues later? So as we sat the two other tables have already received their entrees..Um wth? We were here first. This is a total about maybe 35-40 mintues later, the waitress comes by and stated that the Chef didn't like how my salmon was cooked so he had to recook it. WTH? 

I was thinking off the bat ""Alright if he's actually doing that I better get a salmon that is not overcooked, because I'm going to throw some elbows"". Okay not literally, but you know what I mean..

Anyhow of course when I received the fish it was super over cooked. I thought it was me just upset since we waited an hour for our food. The bf tasted it and we cut the fish apart to see how it was cooked, it was SUPER OVERCOOKED! How can you do that after making me wait for 1 hour? 

I super upset, the waitress didn't offer to help me out too much, I just told her that this wait is unacceptable and she just said ok. She didn't apologize. Another person came along, I'm not sure who she is but I saw her servering other table but she apologized and asked if I wanted another dish, she even offered me dessert. They took the fish out of the bill. I did not eat it after my one bite, I was super upset about the service. 

So Never AGAIN! How do they even get four stars?"
